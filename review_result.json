  "summary": "Step 1:\nThe code filters the DataFrame for purchases with status 'Completed', groups the data by customer_id and month, and calculates the sum of amount for each group.\n\nStep 2:\nThe business logic is to sum the total amount of purchases where status = 'Completed' grouped by customer and month. The code aligns with this logic.\n\nStep 3:\nPASS\n\nStep 4:\nThe code looks well-optimized. It filters early for 'Completed' purchases, uses groupBy and agg functions efficiently.\n\nStep 5:\nScore: 9/10\nThe code is well-optimized with efficient use of PySpark functions. If there are significant amounts of data, considering partitioning strategies could further enhance performance.",
