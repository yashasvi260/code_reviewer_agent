  "summary": "Step 1: The code filters the dataframe to include only rows where status is 'Completed', groups by customer_id and month of purchase_date, and calculates the sum of amount for each group.\n\nStep 2: The business logic requires summing the total amount of purchases where status = 'Completed' grouped by customer and month. The code matches the business logic.\n\nStep 3: PASS\n\nStep 4: The code looks efficient as it filters data early on based on the status condition and performs necessary aggregations. To further optimize, you could consider caching the dataframe if it is reused multiple times, and also check the partitioning scheme for efficiency.\n\nStep 5: 8/10 - The code is already quite optimized with early filtering and aggregation. Caching and partitioning improvements could further enhance performance.\n\nOverall, the code meets the business logic requirements efficiently and has room for minor optimizations for better performance.",
